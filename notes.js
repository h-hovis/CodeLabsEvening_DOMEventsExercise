// Exercise 2

// Objective - Familiarize with DOM events and inline event handlers in web development

// Instructions:

// 1. Create a new HTML file named dom.html and include a button with the class btn and btn_inline.
// 2. Add an onclick event to this button that will call a JS function named changeBackground().
// 3. Within the same HTML file, create a <script> section. Inside this section, define the changeBackground() function. When executed, this function should change the background color of the document.
// Test you code by opening the dom.html in a browser and clicking the button. Did the background color change? If not, debug your code.
